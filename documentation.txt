1. Initiating the problem. 
The problemstatement is to find the hidden message concealed in an image provided in lecture.

2. what is the exact meaning of "the least significant bit of the red values is 
substitued with a bit from the message"?? Interpreted as find the red values from the pixels 
to extract the hidden bit value. 

3. The image is saved as a png file in the same folder as this python script.

4. After researching in RGB, my first intention was to find out how to get the red values from the image.
5. Color Red in RGB is (255,0,0), though Im am not sure if there could be more combination of RGB display color red.
6. Reflecting upon the problemstatement stating "the least significant bit of the red value" 
could mean a lighter or deeper color red?
7. Thinking of finding the possible combination of color red in RGB. (must be many)
8. Attempt to list out the pixels where color red is used.   

9 after finding more information through searching it became apparent that further research was needed regarding
stenography and the meaning of the least significant bit. It means the 3 bits in the right. The research gave me opportunity 
to borrow some usefull code to extract the least significant bits and convert them to binary.

10. Conclusion
Reflection: Perform a better search in beginning and make a clear working process than going in circles and wasting time
figure out unrelevant issues. Finding the red part was not a success, it made me realize my lack of working with colors and pixels.
There are great techs for manipulating RGB, but an overall deeper understanding is required to really grasp the image processing.
